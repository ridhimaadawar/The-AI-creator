# 🤖 The AI Creator – A Personalized Learning System

**The AI Creator** is a conceptual AI-powered platform designed to personalize learning experiences using machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and user-specific analytics.  
This was developed as a **major project** during my final year of **BCA** at **Trinity Institute of Professional Studies (GGSIPU)**.
